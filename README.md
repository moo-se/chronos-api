# api-design

In this project, i have designed and built an API for Chronos from the ground up using Node.js. To handle routes and create my REST API, I used Express.

I incorporated Prisma and TypeScript to read and update data from a PostgreSQL database. This combination made it easy to work with the database while ensuring strong typing and code maintainability.

I also added authentication to my API to secure it with JSON Web Tokens (JWTs). This step was crucial for protecting my API and ensuring that only authorized users could access its resources.

Lastly, I deployed my API using render. Deploying an API is essential to make it accessible to users and other systems.

PS: Chronos is an elegant template that can be used to create a one pager for any product's changelog, recent updates and newly launched features. It can also be used as a personal timeline.
